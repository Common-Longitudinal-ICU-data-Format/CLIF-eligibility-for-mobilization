 ## Code directory

Update this README with the specific project workflow instructions.
This directory contains scripts for the project workflow. The general workflow consists of three main steps: cohort identification, quality control, and analysis. Scripts can be implemented in R or Python, depending on project requirements. Please note that this workflow is just a suggestion, and you may change the structure to suit your project needs.

### General Workflow

1. Run the [cohort_identification.ipynb](cohort_identification.ipynb). Make sure you have all the required tables, variables and elements mentioned at the beginning of the script.
2. Run the [mobilization_analysis.ipynb](mobilization_analysis.ipynb). 
3. Upload results from [output/final](../output/final/) to the project box folder. 

Thank you!
